Installing Piper-TTS on Mac OSX Sequoia (MacBook Pro M1)

    1) Do NOT install Python with Homebrew or with the Python package from website. This doesn't work
    2) Use Homebrew to install Pyenv. (https://mac.install.guide/python/install-pyenv)
    3) Install Python with Pyenv. Only install version 3.11 as onnxruntime doesn't currently play nicely with newer versions
    4) You might need to install pip. If so use this guide: https://mac.install.guide/python/install-pip
    5) make sure that shell is pointing to the Pyenv installed version of python, not the OSX system python Add the following at the end of the ~/.zprofile file.
                    export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
                    [[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
                      eval "$(pyenv init -)"

                    Changes to the ~/.zprofile file will not take effect in the Terminal until you've quit and restarted the terminal. Alternatively (this is easier), you can use the source command to reset the shell environment:
                     $ source ~/.zprofile # Or just restart your terminal
    6) Install Piper-TTS  via pip:  pip install piper-tts
