These are two possible script ideas from Reddit.
Essentially, for general purpose, any text will do for training, BUT the context of the training is important. 
If, for example, I intend to use lots of musical words as my clone reads music theory information, then it would be sensible to use phrases containing appropriate words connected with music theory. E.g. there are multiple words in Italian, German and French for tempo and dynamic markings which would need to be included.

      In a bustling city where the echoes of courtrooms and whispers of justice intertwined, prosecutors had opened a massive investigation into allegations of fixing games and illegal betting. The legal system, like different telescope designs, aimed to expose the truth, each method possessing unique strengths and weaknesses.
      
      As the investigation unfolded, the need to strengthen the education of good lawyers became evident. Feedback from seasoned professionals became crucial; it had to be timely and accurate throughout the project. Just like humans judging distance by the relative sizes of objects, the legal team sought clarity amid the complex web of allegations.
      
      Yet, in the grand scheme of things, this information seemed insignificant. Churches, however, insisted on addressing the issue, emphasizing that they should not encourage such activities or make them look harmless. It was a moral stance against the backdrop of legal intricacies.
      
      Amidst the legal turmoil, individuals found solace in unrelated pursuits, such as learning about setting up wireless network configurations. The city's residents, like the varied ways to consume food, could choose to eat their worries fresh, cooked, or fermented.
      
      Rumors circulated that those who tended to think creatively were somehow different, and if true, they could be the key to unlocking the mystery behind the alleged game-fixing. A creative perspective could be the honeymoon of clarity in this legal fog.
      
      In the courtroom, as the trial progressed, the atmosphere was heated. The sugar syrup of evidence dripped slowly, creating very fine strands of truth that draped over the handles of justice. The accused wiped their brows with their forearms, grappling with the pressure.
      
      The legal system, however, had its quirks. Instead of fixing the issue at hand, they gave it a nickname, a moniker that belied the gravity of the charges. But amid the legal intricacies, about half the people who were infected with the allegations also lost weight, shedding the burden of deceit.
      
      The second half of the legal saga focused on argument and essay writing, a meticulous process of presenting facts and weaving narratives. Funding became an issue after the fact, leaving the legal team to reflect on the odd fashion choice of addressing problems only when they surfaced.
      
      Yet, despite the challenges, there was a prevailing sentiment of encouragement. "Let us encourage each other," became the rallying cry. In the end, as the legal battle continued, individuals found strength in unity, understanding that they had the means to help themselves in the pursuit of truth and justice.
